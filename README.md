Equilibrium Game Thing

#### by Aaron Visser and Edward Wu
- This game is for a project for AP Physics C by Ms. Sharaf. (Period 5)


## Getting Started
- Play the game at [https://edward-wu-19.github.io/statics/](https://edward-wu-19.github.io/statics/)


## Description
### How to Play
- The game is divided into 10 rounds
- In each round, you have 10 seconds to identify the force vector that would neutralize all of the given forces
- When the round starts, press on the particle and drag to draw the force vector
- The net force will be calculated when time is up, or you can press Submit early
- You are awarded points according to how close you were, based on how large in magnitude the net vector is
- The particle will fly off the canvas if you are incorrect (which you are almost guaranteed to be)
- Your total points across the rounds is tracked

### Possible Extensions
- New object (particle) shapes
- Torques!
- More color themes

### Bugs
- No bugs known

### Language
- Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
